## Hi there 👋

My name is Catalina Salguero, an Art Historian and Master of Arts with a specialization in Cultural Management. I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna, Italy.

Although I have a background in the cultural sector, I recently transitioned into digital projects, particularly focusing on UX and UI design, data visualization, and knowledge organization.

Nowadays, I'm collaborating with Neogranadina.org, a Colombian foundation focused on the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage through digital technologies.

I’m currently learning Semantic Digital Libraries, Machine Learning, and Open Access.
