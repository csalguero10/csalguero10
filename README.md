## Hi there 👋

I'm an Art Historian and Master of Arts specializing in Cultural Management. I am pursuing a master’s degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna, Italy.

Although I have a background in the cultural management sector, I recently transitioned into digital projects, particularly focusing on UX and UI design, data visualization, and knowledge organization.

I'm currently collaborating with Neogranadina, a Colombian foundation focused on preserving and disseminating cultural heritage through digital technologies. Additionally, I am working with the Teatro Comunale di Bologna's photographic archive to design a digital system capable of performing tasks such as querying, filtering, normalization, and data visualization using ResearchSpace, an open-source platform designed for the creation, management, and publication of digital collections.

I’m currently learning Semantic Digital Libraries, Machine Learning, and Open Access.
